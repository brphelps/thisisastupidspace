It's 2am and I can't sleep. So naturally, I'm writing a blog post.

## The Problem with Productivity

Everyone talks about optimizing their morning routine. Wake up at 5am. Cold shower. Meditate. Journal. Exercise. All before breakfast.

But what about the rest of us? The ones who do their best thinking when the world is quiet and dark?

## Things I've Learned

- Coffee after 6pm is always a mistake
- But you'll do it anyway
- The best code is written when you should be sleeping
- The worst code is also written when you should be sleeping

## A Quote I Made Up

> "Sleep is just death being shy." - Me, right now, clearly sleep deprived

Anyway, I should probably go to bed. Or make another coffee. We'll see.
