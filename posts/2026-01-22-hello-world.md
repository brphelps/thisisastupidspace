Welcome to my blog. This is a stupid space where I write about whatever comes to mind.

## What to expect

Honestly? I have no idea. Probably things like:

- Random tech experiments
- Thoughts that didn't fit anywhere else
- Projects I'm working on
- Things I learned the hard way

## Why "A Stupid Space"?

Because not everything needs to be polished or profound. Sometimes you just need a place to put stuff.

Stay tuned, or don't. Either way, thanks for stopping by.
